# FLASHPAIR - patched up version

It is the year 2017 and I went back to this "game" that I made in 2000-2001.

It turned out that I miss some files, so I patched it up. The file containing the executable is here : http://clickit.pair.com/software/flashpair/flashpair11-patched.zip

The game runs (almost) flawlessly under Windows 7 and 8, no idea about 10. However, make sure you read this file.

# REGISTRATION CODE

The program will ask you to register.
Just click on the credit card icon (Help/Registration) and type this

# MAPS

The game comes with some flags. There are other images collections here:

Just download and uncompress them in the directory where you put Flashpair. 

# DISACTIVATE SOUND 

It is probably a good idea to turn sound off, because WAV files may not be supported by your system. Just click on the "pencils" icon (Options/Environment) and turn sound off.

Otherwise, just click away the messagebox that appear when you start the game - they should stop popping up eventually.

# INSTRUCTIONS

There are instructions at http://www.amicabile.com/flashpair/

Common problems :
* To start a new game click on the "Plane" (File/New game) icon

#  SOURCE

The source is now available under http://www.github.com/diegoami/flashpair-delphi/

# BUILD THE SOFTWARE

I would not know where to begin, it would be probably better to remake the game from scratch

But seriously, you would need Delphi 5, and figure out what libraries should be installed. I think I included all the necessary ones, but no guarantee.
