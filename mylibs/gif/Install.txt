Follow the steps outlined below for your particular development environment:

For evaluation or DCU versions, replace:
  "GIFImage" with "GIFImage.dcu" and "TimerEx" with "TimerEx.dcu"

For source (purchased) versions, replace:
  "GIFImage" with "GIFImage.pas" and "TimerEx" with "TimerEx.pas"


1) Locate the required files
----------------------------
You'll need the following files for installation:
  GIFImage.dcu (or GIFImage.pas if you purchased the source)
  GIFImage.dcr
  TimerEx.dcu  (or TimerEx.pas if you purchased the source)
  TimerEx.dcr
  Defines.inc  (only if you purchased the source)

You can find GIFImage.dcu and TimerEx.dcu here:
  C++Builder 1: Bin\Builder1
  Delphi 1    : Bin\Delphi1
  Delphi 2    : Bin\Delphi2
  Delphi 3    : Bin\Delphi3
  Delphi 4    : Bin\Delphi4

You can find GIFImage.dcr and TimerEx.dcr here:
  C++Builder 1: Bin\Glyph32
  Delphi 1    : Bin\Glyph16
  Delphi 2    : Bin\Glyph32
  Delphi 3    : Bin\Glyph32
  Delphi 4    : Bin\Glyph32


2) Copy the files to a folder of your choice
--------------------------------------------
Copy them wherever you store your components, let's say it's:
  C:\Source\Components

3) Add the folder to your library search path
---------------------------------------------
This only really necessary for Delphi 1 and Delphi 3. The other compilers do it
automatically (although it can't hurt to make sure).


4) Install the components
-------------------------

  Delphi 1, Delphi 2, C++Builder 1:
  ---------------------------------
  Register the components by add GIFImage and TimeEx to the component library.
  The
  component library will now be rebuilt, and should include TGIFImage and
  TTimerEx.

  Delphi 3, Delphi 4:
  -------------------
  Create a new package and add GIFImage and TimerEx. Compile and Install the
  package. TGIFImage and TTimerEx should now be included on your component
  palette.
